  The links above lead to different uses for <strong>load functions</strong>. Load functions are
  those which run prior to loading the content for a page. They can run on the server or client
  side, or be setup to run first on the server and then on the client the following times.
</p>

<p>Load functions can be useful for many different things, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Data Fetching:</strong> Load functions are commonly used to fetch data from external sources
    such as APIs, databases, or files.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR):</strong> Load functions enable server-side rendering by executing
    on the server when a page is requested, allowing you to pre-render content with data before sending
    it to the client.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Load functions can be used to check user authentication
    and authorization before rendering a page.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Handling Errors:</strong> Load functions allow you to handle errors gracefully. This could
    mean rerouting a user to a login page if they are trying to access a portion of site which requires
    being autheticated, or to a troubleshooting page if other issues occur.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fetching Route Parameters:</strong> Load functions can access route parameters (e.g., URL
    segments) and use them to customize data fetching based on the specific route.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Internationalization (i18n):</strong> Load functions can load language-specific content based
    on the user's preferred language.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are likely to be many other reasons you'll come across as you develop your sites.</p>
