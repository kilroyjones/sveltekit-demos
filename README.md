# SvelteKit demos

This repo contains small, usually single-page demos, illustrating some of the features of
Svelte and SvelteKit. Each is defined as their own route and runs independently of others.
This is as much to help others as it is to better teach myself. In some cases you can find
additional blog posts on my <a href="https://thespatula.io">site</a> which will often lump together
one topic's examples. That being said, everything is, for the most part, duplicated here.
